Recently, my parents made a trip to my grandparents' house, and they brought back my grandpa's old MacBook. It is a MacBook Pro 1,1 complete with an Intel Core Duo processor, 2GB of RAM, and an 80GB hard disk.
OSX Snow Leopard ran a little slow, and was obviously completely useless. It was time for the Linux treatment. Installing Linux on a modern-ish mac is fairly straightforward, so I thought this would be the same way.

<p class="article-paragraph">
<b><em>Boy, was I wrong.</em></b>
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
Modern PCs use the Universal Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), the modern successor to BIOS. Intel-based macs do too, but as always, Apple thought different (did their own nonsense), and made their own implementation of it.
Relatively modern 64-bit Intel macs (without the T2 security chip) with their custom EFI boot Linux fine, with pretty much no tweaking needed.
As it turns out, Apple's firmware on the MacBook Pro 1,1 is significantly different. The following steps try to explain how to install Linux alongside OSX Snow Leopard.
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
First off, install the rEFInd boot manager. I did this by logging in as an administrator user, and running the following.
<div class="article-code">
<code>prithvi $ curl -S webwerks.dl.sourceforge.net/project/refind/0.13.2/refind-bin-0.13.2.zip &gt; refind.zip
...
prithvi $ unzip refind.zip
...
prithvi $ cd refind-bin-0.13.2
prithvi $ sudo ./refind-install
</code>
</div>
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
That's it. When you reboot, you should be greeted by the rEFInd boot manager. Next, fire up Disk Utility in OSX to shrink your OSX partition. Select your physical hard drive, and choose to add a partition.
Give it your desired size, and don't format it (choose format to be empty space).
</p>

<div class="article-image-div">

	<p class="article-image-caption">It should look something like this</p>
</div>

<p class="article-paragraph">
Next, flash a thumb drive with a Linux distro of your choice. I went for Zorin OS Lite (bloatbuntu, I know, I know). Booting to the live environment from rEFInd, create the partitions <em>manually</em> in GParted.
I created only an EFI partition and root partition for Linux as shown, of course not touching OSX.
</p>

	<p class="article-image-caption">Do you notice something different?</p>
</div>

<p class="article-paragraph">
Next, mount OSX's EFI partition, and copy <em>all</em> of its contents to the new EFI partition you just created. From what I've read, OSX doesn't actually use the EFI partition for much more than firmware updates, and not really to store an initial ramdisk or something.
Either way, we now have a redundant copy of rEFInd.
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
My first tries with installing Linux ended in a completely unbootable system, so the redundant EFI partition was more of a precaution than anything else. The contents should look something like this:

<div class="article-code">
<code>prithvi@PVMBP /mnt/OSXEFI&gt; tree
.
└── EFI
    ├── APPLE
    │   └── EXTENSIONS
    │       └── Firmware.scap
    ├── refind
    │   ├── BOOT.CSV
    │   ├── icon
    │   │   ├── ...
    │   │   ├── transparent.png
    │   │   ├── vol_efi.png
    │   │   ├── vol_external.png
    │   │   ├── vol_internal.png
    │   │   ├── vol_net.pn
    │   ├── keys
    │   │   ├── ...
    │   │   ├── refind.cer
    │   ├── refind.conf
    │   ├── refind_ia32.efi
    │   └── vars
    │       └── PreviousBoot
    └── tools
        └── gptsync_ia32.efi
</code>
</div>
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
Next, go through the installer's advanced partitioning, and set it to use the EFI and root partition we created, and nothing more.
Zorin OS's Ubiquity installer made it very easy for me to make it use only the new EFI partition for the bootloader. By default, it used OSX's EFI partition. After this, the only thing left to do is actually install the OS.
