<h1 class="article-title">Fumbling Around with a WiFi Card</h1>

You might remember reading the blurb about the home-refurbished Toshiba laptop, called the PAC, on this site's <a href="/">homepage</a>. The A and C are my friends Aryan and Chirag, and I am the P. Maybe I'll write about how we built it later.
</p>
<p class="article-paragraph">
Anyway, we agreed that we would pass it around each other's houses a couple times a year so that everyone gets to keep and use it (I suppose users getting time slots on a computer never gets old), and that we could use it for whatever we wanted.
</p>
<p class="article-paragraph">
The other day, I found the WiFi card I had salvaged from an old ThinkPad. It used the PCIe minicard form-factor (One of them, at least. An opportune moment for an <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">xkcd comic</a>.) that the PAC happened to use as well.
The Toshiba Satellite A135 the PAC is built from is from 2008. It had some Qualcomm Atheros chipset (Toshiba-branded, a fact whose relevance will soon become apparent) that supported only 802.11bg.
</p>
<p class="article-paragraph">
That ThinkPad was from 2011, and it happened to have an Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300, supporting, well, 802.11n. Yay! All I had to do now was remove the old card, and slot the new one in, right?
</p>
<p class="article-paragraph">
<b><em>Wrong.</em></b>
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
They were different lengths, and there wasn't a screw hole for the shorter length. Well, nothing an old cream cheese tub and soldering iron couldn't fix (the soldering iron was to burn the holes).

<p class="article-paragraph">
Now for the software side of things. When I logged into the Xfce desktop, I'd usually see WiFi connect almost immediately. This time it didn't. <em>Okay.</em>
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
<div class="article-code">
<code>~$ lspci -v
...
03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation Centrino Ultimate-N 6300 [8086:422b] (rev 3e)

</code>
</div>
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
Yay! It recognizes it, and has a driver and everything. I was worried it had one of those Broadcom chipsets that are supposedly super unreliable and need a proprietary driver. All I had to do now was maybe configure a new network connection.
</p>
<p class="article-paragraph">
<b><em>Wrong.</em></b>
</p>
<p class="article-paragraph">
It wouldn't even show up in NetworkManager. Great. To <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/834911/wifi-hard-blocked-on-toshiba-satellite-a665-s6086">StackExchange</a>.
</p>
<p class="article-paragraph">
<div class="article-code">
<code>~$ sudo rfkill list all
0: phy0: Wireless LAN
	Soft blocked: no
	Hard blocked: yes
</code>
</div>
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
<em>Okay.</em> That's something. The motherboard has a little wireless kill switch on it, and suffice it to say that it didn't change much. No amount of <code>modprobe</code>ing and rebooting helped. <em>&lt;Angry kernel sounds&gt;</em>
</p>
<p class="article-paragraph">
By that time, I was frustrated and tired, and didn't want to dig any further. I put the old card back in, and reassembled the box (of course forgetting to screw the motherboard in). I attributed the blocking of the Intel card to the BIOS being locked to the one put in by Toshiba. The preinstalled card was Toshiba-branded anyway.
I put the Intel card back into the box I fished it out of and thought about other things (like the homework I had to do by the next day).
</p>

<p class="article-paragraph">
Why did I write about this? Maybe to guide someone to that StackExchange page if they were having the same problem, though I doubt DuckDuckGo would put this website above StackOverflow in search results. I guess I just wanted to document it, or to paraphrase The Big Bang Theory, <em>because I can</em>.
