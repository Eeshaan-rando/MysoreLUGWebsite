# MysoreLUGWebsite
A Website for the Mysore Linux Users' Group

This site aims to be a medium for Linux users and geeks in general to express their thoughts and spread information.

The webpages themselves are designed to be very, very simple, in contrast to the bloated web of today. As of now, they use no JavaScript, and are completely static. There are no ads, sidebars, or other distractions.

## Contribution
To get started with an article, fork the repository and create a new folder for your article in `articles`, under the appropriate year and month folders.
Any article can be used as a template, as the formatting is uncomplicated.
Once your article reads and looks the way you want it, submit a pull request with your changes. They will be reviewed, and if satisfactory, merged.
The same goes for edits of others' articles, and changes to the format itself.
